This folder stores Room schema JSON files generated by kapt/annotation processing.

If kapt is configured with:
  -Proom.schemaLocation=$projectDir/schemas

Room's annotation processor will write schema snapshots here for each database version. Keep these files under version control to help with migrations and schema reviews.
